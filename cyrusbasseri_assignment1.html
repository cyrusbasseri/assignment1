<!-- 
  Assignment #1 
  Note: I came and visited for office hours due to confusion with saving commits on Github Desktop (I submitted a commit earlier, 
  however there was no content due to not knowing how to save) and figured out how to do it directly after coming to office hours.

        <li> This is my first time developing, so my experience with web development has been challenging </li>
        <li> So far, it seems like you learn best by doing and seeing the result of your code (instant gratification!!) </li>
        <li> I'm driven to become proficient as HTML and CSS are useful skills, unlike many subject taught at university </li>
